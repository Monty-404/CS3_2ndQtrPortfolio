             They have the ability to put on armor and inhabit weapons.</td>
        <td bgcolor="#996633"> They begin to die, catching on fire, when the sun is fully out. Long range weapons, such as the bow, can quickly take them out. Once you keep swinging the sword and hit them with each swing, they cannot damage you.</td>

        <td bgcolor="#996633"> Nearly anywhere in the Overworld </td>
        <td bgcolor="#996633">  They randomly appear out of nowhere and explode when they are close to you. This explosion causes tremendous amount of damage to you.
             Right before they explode, there is a sound that serves as the countdown to the explosion. </td>
        <td bgcolor="#996633"> As you increase your distance from them, they will cancel their explosion. When they are in the middle of an explosion, they stop moving for a few seconds which gives you time
            to run away or cancel their explosion by hitting them. Having a shield can help you block an explosion.

        <td bgcolor="#999999">  They can spot and snipe you with a bow from a distance, far or close. Their shots are fairly accurate. Just like zombies, they are weakened by the sun and also equip
            armor and weapons.
             </td>
        <td bgcolor="#999999"> A shield can easily block their arrows. However, if you have no shield, you can take cover behind trees and blocks or get close to them to engage in melee combat. You can also use a bow to snipe them too and keep your distance
            while dodging their arrows. They fire arrows slower the more you are far away from them.

        <td bgcolor="#999999"> Dark areas, caves in the Overworld  </td>
        <td bgcolor="#999999">  They can climb walls and lunge at you to deal damage. They can also spawn in groups. At night, they are hostile. During the day, they are neutral unless provoked. Some spiders may also be poisonous giving you poison effects which decreases your health over time.
             </td>
        <td bgcolor="#999999"> Make sure to make spiders unable to climb by putting certain blocks like slabs, glass panes, leaves, sugarcane, and bamboo. If you are engaging in melee combat, make sure to keep moving or have a shield to avoid or endure their lunges. If you do not have a death wish,
            don't provoke them at all during the day.

            <td bgcolor="#666666">  They are neutral until provoked which can be done by looking at their eyes or attacking them. They can teleport to dodge attacks and to get closer to you. They deal a lot of damage and can pick up and move certain blocks.
                </td>
            <td bgcolor="#666666"> The best way to avoid provoking them is to not look at them. If you do provoke them, make sure to have a shield to block their attacks. You can also build a 2 block high shelter to hide in since they are 3 blocks tall. You can also move to bodies of water since they take damage from water or cannot go into water.

 <div class="TextBox">
<p> Mobs in Minecraft are another incredible addition to the world and overall the experience to Minecraft. Each mobs have their own set of behaviours, functions, attacks, weaknesses, and much more.
This makes each mob unique to interact with. With every death you take, you learn a little something new to take with your next spawn. There are annoying and also scary mobs but you don't always
have to confront them. If you do, it engages you in a situation where your survival tactics may shine, adapt, and improve. </p>

<p> For something that can and tries to unalive you, it makes the world feel more alive. All of these mobs continue to add to the immersion and the atmosphere of the gigantic and beautiful world of Minecraft. 
    Indeed, we mine, craft, and build but we also must remember to survive. There are dangerous things that exist out there, but there are also ways that exist to survive them. You got this.
